# 24-Game-Calculator
A calculator to find all solutions to a generalization of the 24 game.

## Use

Modify the number of operands, the range for the operands, the operators (modify the source code for this), and the target value then run the calculator program. Please note, that it may take a while to find all equations that are equal to the target. The output will be in a new directory called `solutions` and will be named in the following way: `{targetNumber}_MM_DD_YY_HH_MM_SS.txt`.
